# EDUCATION

Boston University, MS / May 2022

- Master of Science in Software Development

University of Pennsylvania / July 2020

- Computer Science, Post-baccalaureate Studies Program

Boston University, BA / May 2017

- Bachelor of Arts in Neuroscience

# SECURITY CLEARANCE

- Currently holding a Top Secret security clearance.

# WORK EXPERIENCE

# Booz Allen Hamilton

Title: Data Scientist / Dates: February 2024 - January 2025

- Supported Navy clients by providing data visualizations in Qlik and Databricks.
- Lead weekly standup meetings so that our data science team was accountable for billable work.
- Independently analyzed conference data to determine which events/presentations were most impactful.
- Worked in small teams of 2-4 peers on data science projects to increase the efficiency of current workflows.
- Taught several seminars related to data science for a Hiring our Heroes initiative.
- Authored a “Data Science Playbook” for new hires to use as they acclimated to the company.

# ManTech International

Title: Data Scientist / Dates: July 2022 - February 2024

- Independently created a natural language processing pipeline using scikitlearn and TensorFlow that could identify controlled unclassified information (CUI) from non-CUI with 92% accuracy. Automating this process saved the company 75% of the time it takes to label documents.
- Via transfer learning: trained and deployed a custom corrosion detection + classification model that can classify 12 different sub-types of metal corrosion for Naval purposes at 98% accuracy.
- Collaborated with an external AWS team to create a geospatial ML model that could identify cocaine plants from satellite imagery (LandSat and Sentinal-2).
- Deployed an optical character recognition model using Docker, Fast API, and Google Cloud Platform. This containerized model was integrated into a larger machine learning framework that was designed for internal use. The model allowed us to extract 10% more data from articles.
- Trained traditional stats-based models such as k-nn, k-means clustering, SVM, decision trees, random forest, linear and logistic regression, and naïve bayes.
- Wrote project proposals and white papers for several natural language-based projects.
- Mentored a summer intern to develop their fundamental machine learning skills.

# Guardian RFID

Title: AI Python Developer, Dates / July 2021 - July 2022

- Developed AI-based solutions for clients using machine learning techniques in the field of Computer Vision and more specifically facial recognition, object detection, and gait recognition.
- Deployed AI/ML models in AWS Sagemaker via Endpoints, Lambda, and API Gateway.
- Spearheaded a company-wide gait recognition initiative focused on developing a state-of-the-art

# Roche

# Title: MATLAB Developer / Dates: January 2021 - January 2022

- Our team was focused on developing and testing a software library that’s incorporated in automated medical devices.
- Built, and maintained, a GUI that was used to test an automated software library. The GUI accepts user-specified input parameters, generates a test suite, runs these values through our algorithm, and generates a xml file containing the results of execution.
- Designed and produced software in the Object-Oriented Paradigm.
- Used Agile practices in a high-paced team environment (daily standups, sprints, Kanban boards, and increments), and adhered to clean code principles.
- Regularly checked software in/out of a company-wide git repository.

# University of Pennsylvania

# Title: Research Specialist / Dates: March 2019 - January 2021

- Independently managed a computer vision project in Python where a transfer learning of a ResNet-50 model was performed to identify neurons in whole slide immunofluorescence histology images of the human olfactory bulb.
- Developed applications in Python for data acquisition that rely on highly specialized DAQ devices and niche Python packages (NiDAQ cards, Arduino boards, and PowerLab).
- Created a MATLAB function that converts behavioral olfactory-task-based data from HDF5 format into a Microsoft Excel table for data analysis; the function also plots relevant data points for visual inspection and performs preliminary statistical analysis of the raw data.
- Managed a legacy program in Python that is used to track behavior in mice. This program has been passed down through the lab for eight years and has had numerous contributors.

# SKILLS
